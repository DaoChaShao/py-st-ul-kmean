**INTRODUCTION**
---
Welcome to the Customer Segmentation Analysis Platform! This application utilises the Mall Customer dataset to help you
explore customer clustering patterns through unsupervised learning techniques.

**DATASET INTRODUCTION**
---
Using the
classic [Mall Customer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python),
containing basic information of 200 mall customers:

+ CustomerID - Unique identifier
+ Gender - Customer gender
+ Age - Customer age
+ Annual Income (k$) - Annual income in thousands
+ Spending Score (1-100) - Mall spending score

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
---
Through this application, you can:

+ Practice the K-Means clustering algorithm
+ Explore MeanShift density clustering
+ Visualise customer segmentation results
+ Understand applicable scenarios of different clustering algorithms
+ Analyse characteristic patterns of customer groups

**FEATURES**
---

+ Data exploration and visualisation
+ Comparison of multiple unsupervised learning algorithms
+ Interactive parameter adjustment
+ 2D/3D visualisation of clustering results
+ Customer group characteristic analysis

Start your unsupervised learning journey now!

**CHANGELOG**
---
This guide outlines the steps to automatically generate and maintain a project changelog using git-changelog.

1. Install the required dependencies with the command `pip install git-changelog`.
2. Run the command `pip show git-changelog` or `pip show git-changelog | grep Version` to check whether the changelog
   package has been installed and its version.
3. Prepare the configuration file of `pyproject.toml` at the root of the file.
4. The changelog style is [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
5. Run the command `git-changelog`, creating the `Changelog.md` file.
6. Add the file `Changelog.md` to version control with the command `git add Changelog.md` or using the UI interface.
7. Run the command `git-changelog --output CHANGELOG.md` committing the changes and updating the changelog.
8. Push the changes to the remote repository with the command `git push origin main` or using the UI interface.
